# UziFirmware (emscripten)

This scripts allow to compile the firmware to wasm using emscripten. Obviously, you'll need [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) installed.

I'm currently using the following version (on Windows):

```
Î» em++ -v
emcc (Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement + linker emulating GNU ld) 2.0.30 (f782b50a7f8dded7cd0e2c7ee4fed41ab743f5c0)
clang version 14.0.0 (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project c4048d8f50aaf2c4c13b8d3e138abc34a22da754)
Target: wasm32-unknown-emscripten
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: D:/emsdk/upstream/bin
```

**IMPORTANT**: In case `em++` is not found, run the `emsdk_env.bat` (that comes with the emscripten install) to set the env variables for the session.


## Build instructions

I made a batch script that invokes the emscripten compiler. It's not perfect but it works ok. It outputs three files (.html, .js, and .wasm) to the `out/` folder.

To build, just run:

    build.bat

If you want to recompile automatically on changes, run (this uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to watch for changes):

    watch.bat

## Running the compiled program

Even though the build should output an html file to help you get started, I find it full with stuff I don't need so I also added my own `index.html` that just loads the required `<script>` and nothing more.

To run this file is not enough to open it in the browser, you'll need a local webserver to host the files. I'm using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), which works great for this stuff.

    http-server.cmd . -c-1 --mimetypes mime.types -o
