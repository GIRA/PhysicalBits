Do you want to know what makes Physical Bits special? See our list of [key features](./getting_started/FEATURES.md) or simply [download it and try it out](./download/) for yourself.

You can use Physical Bits to build engaging projects using different types of robots. Want to know if your robot kit works with Physical Bits? See the [supported boards](./getting_started/BOARDS.md) for more info.

## Examples

Here we have a simple line follower robot that uses just one sensor to detect the black line.

This next robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to try to keep a constant distance from my hand.

And this robot will wander around the room trying to avoid any obstacle it finds on its way.

These are just some of the many projects you can build using Physical Bits.

Happy programming :)
