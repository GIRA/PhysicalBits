## Starting Physical Bits

First, extract the contents of the downloaded zip file into a folder of your preference.

Depending on your operating system, you should see something like this:

![start_desktop.1](../img/start_desktop.1.png)

Now, you just have to run the `PhysicalBits.exe` (on Windows) or `PhysicalBits` (on macOS and Linux).

The following loading screen should appear right away and, after a few seconds of the robot jumping impatiently, the IDE should open.

![start_desktop.3](../img/start_desktop.3.png)

Before connecting to your Arduino board, you'll need to upload the firmware. Find instructions [here](../getting_started/FIRMWARE.md).

If you find any problem using Physical Bits, please check our [troubleshooting page](../getting_started/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). If you can't find a solution to your problem please submit an [issue](https://github.com/GIRA/PhysicalBits/issues). Thanks!

Happy programming!
