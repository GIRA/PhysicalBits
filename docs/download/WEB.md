## Starting the application

First, extract the contents of the zip file you've just downloaded into a folder of your preference.

You should see the following files:

![start_web.1](../img/start_web.1.png)

Then, if your on Windows just run the `start.bat`. If your on Linux or macOS run the `start.sh`.

You should see a terminal pop up and, after a few seconds, a browser should open with the Physical Bits IDE.

![start_web.2](../img/start_web.2.png)

__IMPORTANT__: If, for some reason the IDE doesn't open automatically, you can do it yourself by pointing your browser to [localhost:3000/ide/index.html](http://localhost:3000/ide/index.html).

![start_web.3](../img/start_web.3.png)

Before connecting to your Arduino board, you'll need to upload the firmware. Find instructions [here](../getting_started/FIRMWARE.md).

You can start programming now!
