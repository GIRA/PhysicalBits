; TODO(Richo): The functions in this namespace rely on the program having its globals
; sorted. That means that I need to remember to call this function before using any
; of them. Of course, I should just change the compiler to emit the program with its
; variables already sorted and avoid this problem. However, in order to do that I need
; to fix a lot of tests first, and it's kind of a pain in the ass. So first, I will
; make it work by calling this function in the correct places and then I'll refactor
; the compiler.
